## Hello world 👋

I'm Quentin, first and foremost an **education enthusiast** with a taste for adventure 🚀

And well, what an adventure 2020 has been...

I guess it was a big deal for pretty much everyone on the planet, so **let me wish you and your loved all the best on that matter**, wherever you are at the moment ❤️

So, after a career journey filled with **diversity, inspiring encounters and passions**, I made the strategic choice of heading straight towards web development, an impenetrable yet intriguing world that I had the occasion to gaze at back when I was working in startups.

Fortunately, this decision has been for the best, as **I happen to absolutely love coding**. And yes, that includes when I spend intimate hours with my laptop to debugging, cleaning my code, debugging again and finally reaching that moment when the magic happens.

🎒  I'm currently getting to the last part of [The Hacking Project](https://www.thehackingproject.org/) bootcamp.

🤖  Over the last 6 months, I've had the occasion to deeply dive into the following tech stack:

- The infamous **HTML/CSS** duo.
- The **Bootstrap** framework, to swiftly code a clean render for your page.
- **Ruby**, as my first backend programmation language.
- **Ruby on Rails**, as my first passport for app deployment.
- **PostgreSQL**, for database management purpose.
- **Javascript ES6**, followed by **React.js**.
- **GitHub** and **Heroku**, to get my code out of its cave.
- A variety of API builds, including notably **Stripe** and **AWS**.

🏆  Proudest achievements:

- [Pulpo Ludo](https://github.com/kentsbrockman/Pulpo-Ludo), the most demanding and complete project of the first part of The Hacking Project training.
- The following tutorial on [How to implement Stripe in a Ruby on Rails app (in French)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzCEMMfx8cQ). Hope it helped the community!
- This particular [Social Network app](https://my-social-network-qplaud.vercel.app/), when I really felt like I understood the key principles of React.
- My first [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/kentsbrockman/TicTacToe-in-Ruby), for the amusing challenge of adding a GUI on top of the game logic itself.

😁  Fun fact: Among my previous jobs, I had the entertaining occasions to work as a **Latin dances teacher**, as well as a **magician**. Did I mention "diversity"?
