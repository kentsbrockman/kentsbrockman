## Hello world 👋

I'm Quentin, first and foremost an **education enthusiast** with a taste for adventure 🚀

And well, what an adventure 2020 has been...

I guess it was a big deal for pretty much everyone on the planet, so **let me wish you and your loved all the best on that matter**, wherever you are at the moment ❤️

So, after a career journey filled with **diversity, inspiring encounters and passions**, I made the strategic choice of heading straight towards web development, an impenetrable yet intriguing world that I had the occasion to gaze at back when I was working in startups.

Fortunately, this decision has quite possibly been for the best, as **I happen to absolutely love coding**. And yes, that includes when I spend intimate hours with my laptop to debugging, cleaning my code, debugging again and finally reaching that moment when the magic happens.

🎒  I'm currently getting to the last part of [The Hacking Project](https://www.thehackingproject.org/) bootcamp.

🤖  Over the last 6 months, I've had the occasion to deeply dive into the following tech stack:\
The infamous **HTML/CSS** duo\
The **Bootstrap** framework, to swiftly code a clean render for your page\
**Ruby**, as my first backend programmation language\
**Ruby on Rails**, as my first passport for app deployment\
**PostgreSQL**, for database management purpose\
**Javascript ES6** (did you say Tic-Tac-Toe?)\
**GitHub** and **Heroku**, that took my code out of the cave\
A variety of API builds, including notably **Stripe** and **AWS**\

🏆  Proudest achievements:\
Tic-Tac-Toe AI\
Social network\
Pulpo\

😁  Fun fact: Among my previous jobs, I had the entertaining occasions to work as a **Latin dances teacher**, as well as a **magician**. Did I mention "diversity"?
